This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.
Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your team know.

Your game must follow the following rules:
• The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.
• The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.
• There must be NPC in your game.
• You need to implement at least one quest.
• The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.
• The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.
• With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.

To give the users the feeling that you’re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible your game.
• Having a pleasant user interface.
• Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)
• Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
